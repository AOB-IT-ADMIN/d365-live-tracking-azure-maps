# Admin & User Guide: D365 Live Tracker

---

## 👨‍💼 Administrator — One-Time Setup

### 1. Azure AD App Registration
Follow [azure-ad-config.md](azure-ad-config.md) and:
- Register **D365 Live Tracker** app
- Grant **Dynamics CRM → `user_impersonation`** API permission + admin consent
- Add redirect URIs (Expo Go + production)
- Copy the **Application (client) ID**

### 2. Create CRM Entity
Follow [crm-entity-setup.md](crm-entity-setup.md) to create:
- Entity: **`cr971_livetracking`** with all required fields
- Security role: Grant Create / Read / Write on `cr971_livetracking` to **Salesperson** role
- Publish all customizations

### 3. Upload Web Resources
Upload from `crm-webresource/` in this order:

| File | Name in D365 | Type |
|---|---|---|
| `css/LiveTrackingMap.css` | `cr971_LiveTrackingMapCSS` | CSS |
| `js/LiveTrackingMap.js` | `cr971_LiveTrackingMapJS` | JavaScript |
| `html/LiveTrackingMap.html` | `cr971_LiveTrackingMapHTML` | HTML |

> ⚠️ Publish **All Customizations** after uploading.

### 4. Configure Azure Maps Key
In `LiveTrackingMap.js`, the `CONFIG` block at the top contains:
```js
const CONFIG = {
    azureMapsKey: 'YOUR_AZURE_MAPS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY',  // ← replace this
    ...
};
```
Replace `YOUR_AZURE_MAPS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` with your actual Azure Maps **Subscription Key**, then re-upload the JS file and publish.

### 5. Distribute to Users
Send each user:
- **Application (client) ID** (from Step 1)
- **Dynamics 365 URL** (e.g., `https://yourorg.crm.dynamics.com`)
